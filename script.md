## "Finally, An AI Built For Product Managers"

---

### TARGET AUDIENCE
Product Managers, Senior PMs, Directors of Product, and Product Leaders

---

## SCRIPT

### [0:00 - 0:05] HOOK
**PRESENTER** *(Direct to camera, slight frustration)*

> "You've tried ChatGPT. You've tried Copilot. But let's be honest—they weren't built for *you*."

**FOOTAGE:** Quick cuts of generic AI interfaces, then a frustrated PM at a desk

---

### [0:05 - 0:12] THE PROBLEM
**PRESENTER** *(Walking, energetic)*

> "Every other profession has AI tools built for them. Developers. Designers. Marketers. But Product Managers? We've been making do with scraps."

**FOOTAGE:** Split screen showing Cursor for devs, Figma AI for designers, then a question mark for PMs

---

### [0:12 - 0:18] INTRODUCING COLLIE
**PRESENTER** *(Stops, faces camera with confidence)*

> "Until now. Introducing **Collie**—the first AI-powered IDE built *exclusively* for Product Managers."

**FOOTAGE:** Collie logo reveal, then app opening with the sleek welcome screen

---

### [0:18 - 0:28] FEATURE SHOWCASE 1: AI ASSISTANT
**PRESENTER** *(Voiceover)*

> "Tell Collie what you need—in plain English. It researches your codebase, drafts your PRD, and saves it. Done."

**FOOTAGE:** 
- User typing in AI chat: "Create a PRD for user authentication"
- AI responding, showing thinking indicator
- Todo list appearing with steps being checked off
- Final PRD file being created automatically

---

### [0:28 - 0:36] FEATURE SHOWCASE 2: TEMPLATES & VISUALS
**PRESENTER** *(Voiceover)*

> "PRDs. Tech specs. User stories. All with professional templates. Plus visual Kanban boards and timelines—right inside your docs."

**FOOTAGE:**
- Command palette opening with `/` showing templates
- Kanban board with drag-and-drop cards
- Timeline editor with phases and milestones

---

### [0:36 - 0:44] FEATURE SHOWCASE 3: STAKEHOLDER MAGIC
**PRESENTER** *(Voiceover)*

> "Add your stakeholders once. @mention them anywhere. Collie knows who owns what—and writes docs accordingly."

**FOOTAGE:**
- Stakeholders panel with roles
- Typing `@Sarah` in chat, dropdown appearing
- AI referencing stakeholder in generated content

---

### [0:44 - 0:52] THE DIFFERENTIATOR
**PRESENTER** *(Back on camera, passionate)*

> "This isn't a chatbot bolted onto a doc editor. This is a purpose-built workspace where AI actually *understands* product management."

**FOOTAGE:** Side-by-side: Generic AI hallucinating vs. Collie generating accurate, contextual PRD sections

---

### [0:52 - 0:57] CALL TO ACTION
**PRESENTER** *(Confident, direct)*

> "Developers have had AI for years. It's time PMs caught up."

**FOOTAGE:** Collie app in full glory, document being saved

---

### [0:57 - 1:00] END CARD
**ON SCREEN:**

> **Collie**

**PRESENTER** *(Final line, warm)*

> "Collie. Finally, an AI that speaks PM."

| **Music** | Modern tech beat, builds momentum, subtle drop at reveal |
| **Color Grade** | Clean, high contrast, matches Collie's dark UI |
| **Text Overlays** | Minimal, only for CTA. Let the app speak for itself |

**Option D:** "Stop explaining product management to your AI."

## PRESENTER DIRECTION

- **Energy:** Knowledgeable peer, not salesy pitch person
- **Wardrobe:** Smart casual (think PM at a top tech company)
- **Setting:** Modern office or standing in front of minimal backdrop
- **Eye Contact:** Direct to camera, builds trust
- **Pace:** Conversational but punchy—this is 60 seconds, no fluff
